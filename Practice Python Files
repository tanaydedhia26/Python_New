Question 1: Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and then prints

The sum
The difference
The product
The average
The distance (absolute value of the difference)
The maximum
The minimum
[ ]
print ("Please enter a number")
x = input ()
x = int(x)
print ("Please enter another number")
y = input ()
y = int(y)
print ("Now we will perform a few tasks:")
print ("The sum is"+' ',x+y)
print ("The difference is"+' ',x-y)
print ("The product is"+' ',x*y)

Please enter a number
8
Please enter another number
3
Now we will perform a few tasks:
The sum is  11
The difference is  5
The product is  24
The average is  5.5
The distance is  5
The maximum is  8
The minimum is  3
Question 2: Write a program that asks the user to input

The number of gallons of gas in the tank
The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
The price of gas per gallon
Then print the cost per 100 miles and how far the car can go with the gas in the tank.

[ ]
from re import M
print ("Please enter the number of gallons in the tank")
x = input ()
x = int(x)
print ("Please enter the fuel efficiency of your car in MPG")
y = input ()
y = float(y)
print ("Please enter the gas price per gallon in dollars")
z = input ()
z = float(z)

Please enter the number of gallons in the tank
10
Please enter the fuel efficiency of your car in MPG
25.3
Please enter the gas price per gallon in dollars
4.9393
The car can travel 253.0 miles.
The cost per 100 miles is 19.52292490118577 dollars.
